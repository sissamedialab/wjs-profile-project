# WJS - JCOM profile

**Experimental**

A django app for Janeway that enriches the `Account` profile with the
field "profession".

**Important**: needs JCOM graphical theme (because of some modified templates)

The branches `as-plugin` and `simpler-name` have this app in the form
of a Janeway's plugin, but I've abandoned them because of difficulties
in test "finding" (ala `manage.py test plugins.myplugin`) and because
I don't need to be able to enable/disable the plugin TTW.

## Install & use

This is a django app that should live inside Janeway. To use it, proceed as follows:

1. Activate your Janeway's virtual environment and install in development mode:
   `pip install -e .../wjs-profile-project`

2. Migrations should be run specifying the sub-package name:
   `./manage.py migrate jcom_profile`
3. Add the following to your local custom janeway settings:
   ```python
   WJS_ARTICLE_ASSIGNMENT_FUNCTIONS = {
       None: "wjs.jcom_profile.events.assignment.default_assign_editors_to_articles",
     }

   ```

4. From `janeway/src`, run the following command:

   ```
   python manage.py run_customizations
   ```
   It will add all our customization to Janeway project.

Please see [this wiki](https://pre-commit.com/) for a detailed list of installation steps.

### Compile frontend assets

To compile frontend assets in the JCOM-Theme theme::

   `./build-assets.sh`

In order for this to work you have to install `sudo apt install inotify-tools`.

### Installing plugins

Installin plugins is handled by `link_plugins` management command which links plugins in janeway directory (if not present already) and run the plugin installation process if not linked yet.

### Running CI-CD like setup

To run CI-CD like setup, you can use the enclosed `docker-compose-test-local.yml` docker-compose file which mount
wjs-profile-project directory as a volume in janeway container to allow to modify the code and run tests without leaving
the docker environment.

See documentation in `docker-compose-test-local.yml` for more details.

### TODO: (aka "not yet implemented"...)

1. Activate your Janeway's virtual environment and install the package
   of this app (please see
   https://gitlab.sissamedialab.it/ml-foss/omlpi/-/packages)

2. Add "wjs\_profession" to Janeway's INSTALLED\_APPS in
   `src/core/janeway\_global\_setting.py` like this::
   ```
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'wjs_profession',
