What is science communication for? We argue that science communication can be
framed, reimagined and transformed in service of social justice, which is what the papers
in this special issue examine. We understand the vocabulary of “social justice” to signal
the centring of critical research and practice paradigms, an ethical commitment to
righting wrongs, building equity for all human beings and the broader ideal of
improving the world [Fraser2003; Sen2009; Young1990]. We argue that bringing
critical social justice lenses to science communication can usefully interrogate,
rethink and ultimately reshape our field. This special issue examines both critical
perspectives on science communication and what equitable transformations might
entail.

<p class="noindent"> What is science communication for? This seemingly simple question (often answered
in a solipsistic way with ‘to communicate science’) when taken seriously compels
us to think quite differently about how, where, with whom and why science
communication activities take place. Indeed, at the heart of this special issue is the
old sociological question about what work certain things <i>do</i> in the world — in
this case, those ‘things’ are the many and varied politics, practices and research
projects that sit under the broad umbrella of science communication. Amidst what
some might read as critiques of science communication, we argue, as the canny
reader will guess from the title of this special issue, that science communication
can be framed, reimagined and transformed in service of social justice, which is
what the papers that follow examine. Indeed, examining the normative politics
that undergird science communication is crucial if we hope to use its language,
tools, concepts and/or practices for different normative purposes, that is, social
justice.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> We understand the vocabulary of “social justice” to signal the centring of critical
research and practice paradigms, an ethical commitment to righting wrongs,
building equity for all human beings and the broader ideal of improving the
world [Fraser2003; Sen2009; Young1990]. We argue that bringing critical social
justice lenses to science communication can do (at least) two useful things for
the field. First, it can help us see more clearly how power plays out in science
communication and the often invisible or tacit ways in which so many people, practices
and knowledges are excluded from science and knowledge production or are
allowed only to participate in very particular and constrained ways [Dawson2019;
RobersonOrthia2021; WilmotIqaniMadondo2023]. Second, it can help us to
reimagine those ideas about who counts, what ideas count and which practices
count in ways that are more meaningfully inclusive [Finlayetal2021; Iqani2023b;
Rasekoala2019; RobersonOrthia2023]. By centring questions of power, inequalities
and the contemporary politics of social movements in our work (including but
not limited to anti-racism, decolonial approaches, crip activism, queer politics,
fourth wave feminism) we can usefully reframe science communication through
the various lenses of social justice. This reframing is not only theoretically and
practically generative, but critical for the relevance and utility of the field as a
whole.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> We argue that most science communication (research, policy and practice) remains
closely tied into the scientistic and policy defined epistemological framings of the late 20th
Century in the Global North [DawsonHughesLockWahome2022; Lock2011]. As such,
colonial frameworks, heteronormative perspectives and scientistic tendencies — to
mention just three forms of structural inequality — too often travel with science
communication [Finlayetal2021; LockArmstrong2023; Rasekoala2023]. What, for
instance, could science communication entail if it did not set up colonial, patriarchal, racist
and/or homophobic modes of relation?
</p>
<p class="noindent"> Historically across our field, little attention has been paid to alternative renderings of
science communication. Today, however, we find ourselves at a time when practitioners
and researchers around the world are doing, thinking and writing differently,
foregrounding social justice in their science communication work (although, we should
note, many have been doing this all along, it has just been harder to read about
their work, not least as a result of anglophone publishing practices in academia).
These alternatives to what Finlayetal2021&lt;empty citation&gt; call “mainstream”
science communication might include paying attention to the everyday realities of
science and society relationships; non-dominant publics; perspectives from the
Global South; affective relations with science and science communication; the
flows of structural power, patterns of oppression and their impact in science
communication; and science’s roles in justifying how marginalised groups, their
knowledges and practices are conceptualised and positioned in relation to itself
[HikuroaSladeGravley2011; Iqani2023a; Noble2013; Race2015; Whitmore2013]. In this
special issue we ask what opportunities are afforded if we work in ways that
do not contribute to entrenched patterns of oppression, but instead support a
broader range of people to understand, question and contribute to science in our
societies?
</p>
<p class="noindent"> One key question that arises in relation to social justice in science communication has
to do with the global politics of knowledge. The world has been shaped by violent legacies
of colonialism, which as well as decimating peoples and cultures, also forged specific
hierarchies of scientific knowledge, framing western paradigms as superior, and African,
Asian, Arab, and Indigenous science as inferior. Therefore, the project of science
communication for social justice should explicitly seek routes towards what viola milton
and Winston Mano [miltonMano2022] call, “epistemological conviviality”, that
is, broadening the canvas of theoretical framings to welcome in knowledges
that were injured or ignored by Western science. The more we welcome new
empirical data and theoretical insights embedded in non-Western settings into
the journals and academic conversations that are hosted and controlled by the
Western academy, the more inclusive the project of science communication can
become.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> With contributions from around the world and across a range of social justice topics,
this collection of papers represents a significant shift in how science communication
is understood and enacted. Notably, thinking with political philosopher Lois
Mcnay2022&lt;empty citation&gt;, it is crucial that we reflect on how social justice and science
communication combine differently in different contexts and perspectives. People, and the
socio-political histories they live with, change in small and larger ways from one day to
the next, as well as across communities, and the local, national and regional levels, yet
power-geometries also linger, shaping structural inequalities across time and space. As a
result, seemingly similar science communication practices, languages and concepts can
play out very differently, depending, for instance, on histories of settler colonialism,
national or international geo-politics, or the overlaps between socio-cultural
identities and structural inequalities [Massey1994; Ngugi1986; Warner2005].
There is no one size fits all model, although many have been offered (calls for
‘engagement’ or ‘dialogue’ spring to mind). The papers in this special issue, each
located in their specific context, mobilise different critical perspectives to examine
social justice themes within science communication. We invite readers to reflect
with each paper on how these issues, ideas and practices might apply in their
context, what they would change, add or remove, and what they might learn
from.

<p class="noindent"> Martha Marandino and Maria Paula Meneses [MarandinoMeneses2024] bring an
‘Epistemologies of the South’ critical lens to the <i>Peoples and Plants</i> exhibition at the
Museum of Natural History and Science, Portugal. Their research paper via detailed
content analyses and interviews with visitors, details the multiple ways in which colonial
violences and local knowledges can be silenced and erased within the natural history
museum setting. They argue in favour of practices that do not automatically adopt
the monocultural approaches, knowledges, and narratives of western science
in interpreting artefacts and histories of the global south. The paper therefore
raises important questions for practices of communication and display within
the wider museum sector to encourage approaches rooted in social justice and
decolonialism.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> An alternative framing of science-society relationships, rooted in the mid-century and
post-Indian independence concept of “scientific temper”, is outlined in the essay from
Siddharth Kankaria and Anwesha Chakraborty [KankariaChakraborty2024]. By
de-centring our established concepts and theories of science communication models,
publics and practices away from the Global North, the essay proposes an alternative
critical perspective which positions citizens as active interrogators and critical participants
in a less binarised ecosystem of science-society interactions. Crucially, the essay
encourages us to interrogate our own institutional practices to ensure that we do not
reproduce systemic issues in science, including “hegemonic ivory towers, power
dynamics and information asymmetries”.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> Chase Ledin’s [Ledin2024] theoretical paper takes an in-depth approach to thinking
about gender, sexuality, sex, knowledge and queer theory in science communication, in
relation to social justice. He argues that moving beyond identitarian politics offers people
working in science communication a useful way to rethink ‘inclusion’. Crucially, his work
points to one way that science communication might be productively queered, that is, to
reconsider the normative politics of science communication from the perspective of
often-invisibilised queer publics.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> Drawing on empirical data from the US, in their paper Evelyn Valdez-Ward and her
colleagues [Valdez-Wardetal2024] discuss their analysis of surveys from a science
communication training scheme. The Reclaiming STEM workshops served scientists from
marginalised identities, who benefited from training that made structural inequalities
explicit. Their testimonies are emotional, distressing and insightful. The paper reminds us
that leaving injustices unexamined does not mean they go away. Instead, as Valdez-Ward
et al. [Valdez-Wardetal2024] highlight in their work, making justice concerns
explicit is valuable for science communication training and speaks to why many
scientists from marginalised groups embark on science communication in the first
place.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> Marie McEntee, Mark Harvey, Fabien Medvecky [McEnteeHarveyMedvecky2024]
offer a new paradigm for thinking about science communication from the south, in this
case Aotearoa New Zealand. Considering the challenges of communicating the science
of forest biosecurity and plant pathogens, the authors recalibrate a theoretical
framework for the problem by drawing on Indigenous knowledge systems. They show
how, while Western epistemic systems rank and assign credibility hierarchically,
the mātauranga Māori knowledge ecology forges more inclusive forms of
understanding, engagement and activism. The researchers treat mātauranga
Māori knowledge as equivalent to Western paradigms, which is revolutionary
considering how colonial legacies elevated the latter at the expense of the former.
Arguably, the project of science communication for social justice will require
similar projects of elevating Indigenous knowledge systems to their rightful place,
alongside those already accepted as valid in the field, from many other global south
locations.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> The experiences of a global science communication project funded by the European
Commission are the topic of reflection in the paper by Joseph Roche and colleagues
[Rocheetal2024]. The legacies of colonialism are apparent in the economics of the global
research funding system, with countries in the north typically bestowing grants to
researchers in the south, or to study issues that matter to the south, or to set up projects
that invite participation from researchers in the south. The paper offers some revealing
reflections on that politics, and how ideas about the right and wrong way to do science
communication are produced by the political-economy of funding, usually coming from
the north, with researchers and practitioners in the south framed as recipients
of those models. It also raises the question of what social justice means if and
when its aims become codified in the lexicon (and resource control) of funding
bodies.
</p>
<p class="noindent"> Of course, there are myriad issues and critical perspectives rooted in a commitment to
social justice to bring to bear on this emergent facet of science communication practice and
research. Those offered here work through different aspects of themes that we feel should
be more central to the discipline, including (but not limited to) inclusion/exclusion,
relationships between hegemonic, marginalised and silenced knowledges and
Global South/North politics. What, for instance, does it mean to be “included”
in science communication, if we don’t attend to the structural forms of power
that shape these spaces, practices and knowledges? What has to be left out, in
order to gain admittance to these hallowed halls? Turning to geopolitics, it is
crucial we attend to the politics of funding, how it is controlled, disseminated and
valued. Not least, as many of the papers in this special issue demonstrate, because
colonial legacies continue to shape the knowledge project. What does it take to put
knowledge from the Global South on a par with knowledge from the Global
North?
</p>
<p class="noindent"> Finally, we want to reflect on the deep joy we felt working together as editors, working
with all of the contributing authors and with the journal team in putting together
this special issue. We especially want to thank the JCOM editors for seeing the
value in this corpus of work, which has, in our experience and as attested to
elsewhere, not always been recognised as relevant to the whole of the science
communication discipline, but relegated to the sidelines as a niche issue [Chatterjee2023;
Finlayetal2021; MenezesMurray-JohnsonSmithTrautmannAzizi2022; Orthia2020;
RasekoalaOrthia2020]. In this special issue we are delighted to celebrate the work of our
insightful authors, many of whom are early-career researchers, which leads us to hope
that the discipline is changing shape. We hope readers will similarly feel challenged,
yet hopeful about the opportunities these different perspectives bring to our
field.
