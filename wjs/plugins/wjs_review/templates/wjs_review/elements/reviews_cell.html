Janeway uses `article.reviews_not_withdrawn`, but this QS
- includes review assignments for all review rounds, not just from the last one
- the semantics is unclear/hacky:
  - ReviewAssignments have a field called "decision" whose verbose_name is "Recommendation"
  - ReviewAssignments with decicision="withdrawn" are excluded
  It seems that Janeway is "overloading" the semantic of the decision field.
