    Janeway uses `article.reviews_not_withdrawn`, but this QS
    - includes review assignments for all review rounds, not just from the last one
    - the semantics is unclear/hacky:
    - ReviewAssignments have a field called "decision" whose verbose_name is "Recommendation"
    - ReviewAssignments with decicision="withdrawn" are excluded
    It seems that Janeway is "overloading" the semantic of the decision field.
