   Introduction

  <p class="indent">
   Citizen Science (CS) refers to the engagement of the public in scientific research to
generate knowledge of relevance for science and society [

   Vohland et al.,
   <a href="#X0-VohlandLand-ZandstraCeccaronietal2021">

initiatives are popular in biodiversity research where citizen scientists participate in the
identification, recording and monitoring of biodiversity [

   Theobald et al.,
   <a href="#X0-TheobaldEttingerBurgessetal2015">

   Turb&#233; et al.,
   <a href="#X0-TurbeBarbaPelachoetal2019">

contribute to personal and social benefits for participants through increased
interest in a subject, literacy, skills, changes in attitudes, self-efficacy and behaviour

However, the representation of participants does not always adequately reflect the
demographics of general populations, excluding certain age-groups, genders,
ethnicities and socio-economic groups from these benefits [

disadvantaged groups in science (e.g. of African descent, Latinos, American Indians) have
been documented [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,
   <a href="#X0-PandyaDibnerNASEM2018">
    2018

Age also shapes participation with lower levels among younger age groups (e.g.,
25&#8211;34-year-olds) compared to middle-aged and older people [

the potential to bring new aspirations, perspectives and knowledge to support
scientific enquiry [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,

   In this paper, we focus on the issue of broadening diversity in CS through the
engagement of young people from different CS backgrounds. A range of benefits for
young people emanate from their participation in CS including: educational and learning
opportunities, emotional and physical benefits and improved interpersonal and social
skills [

   To our knowledge, much research on what engages young people in CS centres
on existing volunteers. Efforts to understand what may motivate those who
have not previously participated in CS are lacking. In this study, we explore
factors that determine young people&#8217;s (aged 18&#8211;29) participation in CS with
different CS experiences. Our research centres on a case study CS project being
initiated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) titled: the Volunteer
Monitoring of Farm Wildlife (VMFW) project where volunteers carry out multi taxa
biodiversity surveys to support long-term monitoring and conservation efforts on
farmland. This study aims to explore the motivations, opportunities and barriers for
engaging volunteers in such an initiative. The data will be used to inform CS
project design, volunteer recruitment strategies, with a broader aim to enhance the
diversity of volunteers and the design of volunteering activities into the future.
The following research questions were explored: (1) What are the motivations
of young people for participating in CS initiatives? (2) What are the barriers
for engaging young people in CS initiatives? and (3) How can these barriers be
overcome to encourage the participation of young people in our prospective CS
initiative?

   Methods
  </h1>
  <p class="indent">
   Qualitative data was collected through online focus group discussions (FGDs)
conducted via Zoom. Qualitative methods are important because they are less
structured, more open and flexible then quantitative approaches and enable
opportunities for reflexivity of responses, in-depth analysis and the generation of
novel findings [
   <a id="x1-5001">
   </a>
   Drury, Homewood &amp; Randall,
   <a href="#X0-DruryHomewoodRandall2011">
    2011
   </a>
   ]. FGDs centre on engaging
selected groups of people to discuss perspectives on a specific topic, to share
understandings and to identify the influence of different voices in the group [Drury et al.,
   <a href="#X0-DruryHomewoodRandall2011">
    2011
   </a>
   ].
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   We selected participants between the ages of 18&#8211;29 with previous environmental CS
experience (E-CS), those with non-environmental CS experience (NE-CS) and those
with no CS experience (N-CS). Participants were recruited via a series of online
advertisements through a network of environmental volunteering organisations
and their social media platforms. These organisations were identified through a
snowball sampling approach beginning with the first authors own organisational
affiliations and then asking other organisations to recommend other places to
advertise through their own networks. In order to reach participants beyond the
environmental sector the first author, identified a list of organisations outside of the
environmental sector that offer citizen science opportunities as well as a number of
university union organisations, colleges and community groups to advertise the focus
group opportunity more widely. Participants were asked prior questions about
their previous CS experience, gender and residence in urban or rural settings
to allocate them to different FGDs (Table
   <a href="#x1-50021">
    1
   </a>
   ). Four people couldn&#8217;t attend the
FGDs during the allocated times and provided written responses to the FGD
questions.

   An information sheet outlining the aims and objectives of the study, details of the date,
time and location of the FGDs, use and storage of the data, issues of informed consent and
confidentiality were circulated prior to discussions. The information sheet asked
participants for their signed informed consent which was approved by the RSPB Centre
for Conservation Science Human Ethics Committee.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   The FGDs took place on April 2021 on Zoom for a period of two hours. At the
beginning of each FGD, we went through the consent form to ensure everyone signed the
form and asked permission for the FGD to be audio recorded. The FGDs were
semi-structured and guided by a series of themes and open-ended questions giving
opportunities for respondents to elaborate on their thoughts (Table
   <a href="#x1-50032">

   </a>
   ). Questions explored
understanding of the meaning of the term CS, interest, motivations and barriers for
participating in CS in general and our case study and recommendations for broadening
participation.

   Data analysis
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded using a modified grounded
theory approach to interpret the data that allowed for priori categories/codes coupled
with the identification of emergent themes, which allow the researcher to identify and
apply relevant theoretical frameworks [
   <a id="x1-6001">
   </a>
   Emerson, Fretz &amp; Shaw,
   <a href="#X0-EmersonFretzShaw2011">
    2011
   </a>
   ]. The strengths of
this interpretative analysis allow for the identification of novel themes, categories and
interpretations that participants drew upon when describing their motivations, barriers
and recommendations for participating in CS. The transcripts were deductively coded for
dominant narratives that encompass young people&#8217;s motivations, barriers and
recommendations. Participant&#8217;s anonymity and confidentiality was ensured by giving
each interviewee an identification code (e.g., V1) and an identifying code of the
FGD.

   Career development
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   For young people with E-CS and NE-CS experience, volunteering was seen as
pre-requisite to secure work in the conservation sector. Many graduate students with
conservation-related degrees believed their course did not provide adequate practical
skills and training therefore, participation was essential for employability. Across all
FGDs, CS was an opportunity to gain specific work skills such as managerial expertise,
bolster resumes and inform future career paths:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">
   <blockquote class="quote">
    <p class="noindent">
     <i>
      I guess the thing about that opportunity was that it was very science and monitoring
 focused, which was the area that I was looking to gain experience within and team like
 opportunities. There were many supporting pieces that allowed me to get involved with
 visitor experience, an event or practical work on a reserve. It was a very good way of
 testing whether you want to work within this sector

     (V4, E-CS).
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">
   Those with NE-CS and N-CS experience, were motivated by opportunities that
strengthened university, or job applications and improved their resume. Meanwhile, those
with N-CS experience, were interested in opportunities for mentorship and sourcing
referees.

   Developing new interests and knowledge
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Across all FGDs, young people believed a prior interest in a topic was essential for their
participation. Among all FGDs, young people were interested in gaining new insights and
knowledge into a topic they found interesting or to obtain a greater understanding of an
industry or organisation. Those with E-CS and NE-CS experience, viewed their
participation as an opportunity to determine their interests in a subject and to put their
knowledge and skills into practice.

  <p class="indent">
   Across all FGDs, young people were motivated to give back to a cause that aligned with
their personal values, made a positive contribution to the environment, local area, or
community. Similarly, young people across all groups, were attracted to opportunities
where they were making an observable difference. This could include helping a
community to secure funding for a project, creating a habitat for a species and seeing the
benefits of their work:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">
   <blockquote class="quote">
    <p class="noindent">
     <i>
      Doing something as well is quite nice for nature, and often volunteering is quite
 rewarding when you are seeing the difference in what you&#8217;re doing. For example, if
 you have created something or you&#8217;re seeing new species moving into an area, after
 providing a habitat for them
     </i>
     (V1, E-CS).
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">
   Young people with E-CS experience were attracted to opportunities that allowed
them to contribute their knowledge and expertise to support a cause. A few
individuals with NE-CS experience described situations where they worked with other
volunteers from a different cultural background. In one example, a participant
described how social interactions with other volunteers made her aware of other
people&#8217;s life experiences causing her to self-reflect on her own privileges. From this
experience, she was attracted to opportunities that allowed her to work with people
from disadvantaged backgrounds and projects that furthered a specific social
cause.

   Across all FGDs, young people were attracted to a welcoming and friendly environment.
Young people with E-CS experience, were attracted to projects without hierarchical
management structures and opportunities that were open to all regardless of prior
experience. A young woman who worked on several activist projects stated:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">

   Logistical constraints
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Among all FGDs, young people discussed the unpaid aspect of volunteering which has
negative impacts due to the high costs of living, the problem of maintaining full-time
work and high participation costs such as transport, accommodation and equipment
purchases. Across all FGDs, a lack of access to transport was cited, particularly in
rural areas. Similarly, a lack of available accommodation was a major concern:

     <i>
      I think there&#8217;s a lot of factors, like access, and physical transportation, especially in rural
 communities, transport is a big issue and that&#8217;s a barrier to get to certain sites that are
 more rural. Secondly, I would say that unpaid volunteering can be hard for people who
 don&#8217;t have the time to do that, because they need money to pay rent and food, and just
 living. Thirdly, in certain areas, housing is also expensive

  <p class="noindent">
   Across all FGDs, the timing of events was mentioned. Many individuals described
how most opportunities take place during the working week, offering limited flexibility
for those in full-time study or employment.

   Lack of knowledge and interest
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Across all FGDs, a lack of knowledge of opportunities was attributed to a lack of peer,
family or co-worker networks who were not active in CS:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">
   <blockquote class="quote">
    <p class="noindent">
     <i>
      Firstly, it&#8217;s the whole being aware of what&#8217;s around you, you might be able to go and
 visit lots of like Wildlife Trust reserves, but not necessarily know that the volunteering
 goes on there. So, I think that can be sometimes a problem. Especially if you don&#8217;t know
 people that are already volunteering, or you don&#8217;t have people around you that are aware
     </i>
     (V1, E-CS).
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">
   A lack of knowledge of opportunities was associated with poor advertisements and
marketing. Several individuals with E-CS experience, explained that searching for
opportunities online was overwhelming particularly, when advertisements did not
effectively communicate the role, purpose, requirements and benefits of the scheme. A
lack of interest in a particular subject was frequently cited among those that with NE-CS
and N-CS experience and the importance of seeing young people from similar
socio-economic backgrounds:

 do it without others from a similar background and even if they had heard of it, many
 wouldn&#8217;t get involved in an organisation they knew nobody from

     (V22, NE-CS).

   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">
   Among those with N-CS experience, CS was often associated with older people
therefore, the potential benefits accrued from participating were often unknown or not
relatable. This group also highlighted how negative judgements from project organisers
and other volunteers of their abilities would negatively affect their confidence to
participate:

   Programmatic/organisational issues
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Those with E-CS and NE-CS experience, identified complex and demanding application
processes and roles that require specialist skills as deterring them from applying.
Similarly, those with E-CS experience, highlighted unwelcoming environments and poor
or hostile relationships between project staff and volunteers. This group also identified a
lack confidence in their role due to poor training, communication and support from
project leaders:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">

 volunteers. I&#8217;m having this problem, what do I do? I think the idea of just not knowing
 100% what you&#8217;re doing and feeling alone is a huge turn off

     (V8, E-CS).
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">
   Those with NE-CS and N-CS experience, explained that being allocated the boring and
repetitive tasks would deter them due to a lack of variety, as well as fears of
lone working on farms particularly for women. Those with N-CS experience,
were not attracted to competitive working environments, or poorly managed
projects.

   A range of recommendations were identified from FGDs to broaden the diversity of young
people in our proposed CS initiative including: overcoming logistical constraints, raising
awareness and improving communications, overcoming programmatic and organisational
issues, enhancing social opportunities, diversifying CS roles and create tangible impacts

   Those with NE-CS and N-CS experience, advocated for organisations to cover the
expenses of citizen scientists. Across all FGDs, several individuals suggested reimbursing
participant transport, accommodation and equipment costs, providing lift shares or
residential accommodation. Extending the timing of events to evenings in the summer,
weekends and student vacation periods and offering taster sessions for new
volunteers to experience an event before making a longer-term commitment was also
important.

   Raising awareness and improve communications
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Across all FGDs, participants identified a need to improve the content of advertisements
by describing the purpose, cause, expectations, support offered and the benefits of the
initiative to prospective citizen scientists. Some individuals suggested encouraging citizen
scientists to document and share stories of their experiences through blogs and videos so
others could learn about the project. Across all FGDs, several individuals suggested
broadening the dissemination of adverts through social media platforms and connecting
with universities and colleges, workplaces, churches and community groups to advertise
opportunities more widely:

  <blockquote class="quote">
   <blockquote class="quote">
    <p class="noindent">

     (V22, NE-CS).
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="noindent">
   Those with E-CS experience, believed sustained participation was dependant on
maintaining regular communications with volunteers through blogs, newsletters, and
engagement events to keep them updated on project progress.

   Overcoming organisational/programmatic issues
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Those with E-CS experience, suggested making some CS roles less specialist and open to
amateurs. Several individuals emphasised the importance of providing adequate training
and support and developing a buddy system or &#8216;task force groups&#8217; where participants
work together. These activities were thought to foster team cohesion and overcome issues
of lone working. In turn, giving citizen scientists a voice to offer feedback on
project progress through face to face and online discussions with project staff was
important. Across all FGDs, fostering a welcoming environment with opportunities to
recognise and reward volunteers to cultivate a sense of belonging was suggested:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">

  <p class="indent">
   Across all FGDs, young people suggested developing face to face and online events for
participants to socialise with one another and project organisers. Those with E-CS
and N-CS experience, suggested facilitating communications online through
forums, or messaging groups for citizen scientists to raise issues and offer feedback.
Those with NE-CS experience, suggested allowing participants to bring friends
from different backgrounds along to events to encourage wider participation:

   Diversifying citizen science roles
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Those with E-CS and NE-CS experience, suggested creating digital CS roles and working
with students from arts and digital backgrounds to bolster project communications for
example, by documenting and sharing experiences through blogs, newsletters and videos.
Similarly, engagement and outreach roles were suggested where individuals act as
ambassadors to give talks and raise awareness of the project to target groups, or to
help meet the needs of the landowners where the research was taking place:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">
   <blockquote class="quote">
    <p class="noindent">
     <i>
      It would be great to have a platform through which volunteers and famers could
 communicate with each other such as a community forum. I know of a farm where
 the farmer rents out strips of his fields for agroforestry. The strips can be planted with
 different trees which companies can then make use of (such as nut trees). This gives us
 an opportunity for farmers to rent out land and connect with people outside of farming.
 When buffer zones are introduced next to water for example, on farmland these areas
 can be used for biodiversity to grow a new crop. Could volunteers then be responsible
 for helping to market the new crop?
     </i>
     (V6, NE-CS).

   Those with E-CS experience, valued projects that provided evidence of their participation
through a certificate of skills acquired, or logbook of volunteer hours. Those with
E-CS and NE-CS experience, discussed the value of making a visible impact on a
particular cause. For example, in our proposed initiative, several young people
expressed an interest in working with farmers and scientists to create management
plans from the wildlife survey data and giving talks to share project news with
farmers and community groups. Those with NE-CS experience, discussed the
importance of recognising the value citizen scientists bring to a project through reward
systems that make young people feel valued and appreciated such as certificates of
acknowledgement and organising events for volunteers and team members to celebrate
their contributions.

   Motivations
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   There was an overlap in motivations expressed for participating in CS among young
people with different CS experiences, but also some key differences. Our research findings
showed that motivations for career progression were unified across the groups, matching
previous studies [
   <a id="x1-27001">
   </a>
   West et al.,
   <a href="#X0-WestDykePateman2021">
    2021
   </a>
   ]. Individuals from all CS experiences were drawn to
opportunities that offered diverse experiences to bolster their knowledge and practical
skills, although the focus differed across groups, with different ambitions to build their
resume, support university and job applications, establish networks, mentorship and
build their reputation [
   <a id="x1-27002">
   </a>
   Alender,
   <a href="#X0-Alender2016">

   </a>
   ; Ng, Duncan &amp; Koper,
   <a href="#X0-NgDuncanKoper2018">
    2018
   </a>
   ]. Our
study identified mentorship as a unique motivation to those without previous CS
experience, these individuals described previous internships and work placements
that allowed them to further their skills and knowledge in particular sectors.
Mentorship discussions were also linked to securing reliable references to advance their
careers. Therefore, one strategy for attracting non-engaged groups may be to
include a mentorship component to enable knowledge sharing and learning for
participants [Ng et al.,
   <a href="#X0-NgDuncanKoper2018">
    2018
   </a>
   ], with the added value of mentors serving as first time
referees.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   The opportunity to learn new things was also a common motivator for participation
across different CS experiences [
   <a id="x1-27005">
   </a>
   Asingizwe et al.,
   <a href="#X0-AsingizwePoortvlietKoenraadtetal2020">

   <a href="#X0-GanzevoortvandenBornHalffmanTurnhout2017">
    2017
   </a>
   ]. However, our study found that only participants
with previous CS experience were motivated by experiences that allowed them
to develop and ascertain their own interests. CS offers volunteers a chance to
try out a diversity of roles including data collection experiences, independent
fieldwork, analysis and dissemination of data to better understand their skill sets and
interest. Creating flexibility within CS roles to allow citizen scientists to carry out a
diversity of tasks may create new learning opportunities and pathways for career
progression.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Our study also found that young people across all CS experiences exhibit altruistic
motivations for participation and were attracted to initiatives that allow them to visibly
impact a particular cause. In our study, young people also demonstrated a preference for
CS projects that also offer social interactions for volunteers to meet likeminded people
particularly, when moving to a new area. Altruistic motivations are common among
young people in the initial phases of recruitment, but also to sustain their long-term
participation particularly, for projects which centre on fostering social interactions through
enhanced community engagement and advocacy [
   <a id="x1-27007">
   </a>
   Ward-Fear, Pauly, Vendetti &amp; Shine,
   <a href="#X0-Ward-FearPaulyVendettiShine2020">
    2020
   </a>
   ]. Interestingly, only those with NE-CS experience, identified several unique
motivators including the social aspect of meeting other volunteers and community
members from different backgrounds that caused them to &#8216;raise their awareness
of their own privileges&#8217;. The integration of community engagement goals to a
project may enhance feelings of being part of a community, belonginess and
enhanced knowledge and awareness of social issues that are rarely touched on in the
literature.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Inclusivity was also highlighted as a common motivator among all groups particularly
when CS projects are open to all irrespective of prior experience. Young people were
motivated to contribute their own knowledge and expertise to a cause and were attracted
to opportunities that provide a forum to voice their ideas and opinions. CS has the
potential for scientists and citizens to interact and mutually share knowledge. However,
this level of involvement is dependent on the type of CS project [

   R&#252;fenacht
et al.,
   <a href="#X0-RufenachtWoodsAgnelloetal2021">
    2021
   </a>
   ]. Contributory projects operate where citizen scientists act primarily
as data collectors, collaborative projects, allow opportunities for participation
beyond data collection and co-created projects, are co-designed, developed and
executed by scientists and the public [
   <a id="x1-27009">
   </a>
   Shirk et al.,
   <a href="#X0-ShirkBallardWildermanetal2012">
    2012

   ]. Examples of co-created
CS initiatives include the Networked Youth Research for Empowerment in the
Digital society (WYRED) Project that have developed a framework to promote
the transfer of perspectives, knowledge and ideas among young people and
decision-makers on topics related to gender stereotypes on the internet [

voice to participants in CS may provide intangible benefits through increased
empowerment and self-efficacy [

  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Finally, unique to those with E-CS experience, citizen scientists were attracted to
opportunities that allow them to connect with new places and nature. Young people with
E-CS experience enjoyed participating in projects where they could pursue outdoor
activities such as birdwatching. Human-wildlife interactions have also been shown
to have positive impacts on human well-being [

motivator for young people across all groups. Across all groups, the need to get
outside was also justified by the recent lockdowns enforced under the COVID-19
pandemic. One study highlighted the role that time outdoors and in nature can
play in bolstering young people&#8217;s resilience to stressors such as the COVID-19
pandemic; underscoring the need to facilitate outdoor recreation opportunities for
youth during times of crisis [

   Barriers for participation
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   Participation in CS requires financial resources and an investment of time. In our study,
across all groups, logistical barriers such as being unpaid, the lack of transport or
accommodation, prohibitive participation costs and the timing of volunteer opportunities
were clear barriers to participation commonly reported in the literature [
   <a id="x1-28001">
   </a>
   Winch, Stafford,
Gillingham, Thorsen &amp; Diaz,
   <a href="#X0-WinchStaffordGillinghametal2021">
    2021
   </a>
   ].
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   A lack of awareness of CS opportunities were a barrier, attributed to poor social, family
or work networks. A plethora of research identifies a positive relationship between the
social capital of individuals, defined as the ability of actors to secure a benefit by virtue of
membership in a social network [
   <a id="x1-28002">
   </a>
   Portes,
   <a href="#X0-Portes1998">

   </a>
   Layton &amp; Moreno,
   <a href="#X0-LaytonMoreno2014">
    2014
   </a>
   ].
Therefore, people with low levels of social capital may be less likely to participate, because
they lack the networks that know of CS opportunities [
   <a id="x1-28004">
   </a>
   Forbes &amp; Zampelli,
   <a href="#X0-ForbesZampelli2014">

interest in the topic was also cited as a barrier for participation following other studies that
have shown similar findings [

   </a>
   Pandya,
   <a href="#X0-Pandya2012">
    2012
   </a>
   ]. For those with no CS experience, lacking
knowledge or formal education in a particular subject limited confidence in their own
abilities to participate. This is corroborated by other studies that show a higher
dominance of participants in CS with higher education levels [
   <a id="x1-28006">
   </a>
   Merenlender et al.,
   <a href="#X0-MerenlenderCrallDrilletal2016">
    2016
   </a>
   ].
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Poor advertising by not selling the benefits of the programme was also a barrier for
participation. A recent review paper of volunteerism suggests young people can hold
negative views about volunteering that influences their participation [

   </a>
   Southby, South &amp;
Bagnall,

CS experience, that CS and volunteering were for older people. Therefore, this group
could not easily envisage the benefits of their participation. Related to not seeing
benefits, is not seeing people from the same socio-economic background, that
prohibited certain groups of young people from participating. Sometimes CS
opportunities may also be organised in unfamiliar, alienating, or non-inclusive
environments [

   <a href="#X0-HinojosaSwisherGarneau2021">
    2021
   </a>
   ]. For example, some environmental CS
projects are often located in the countryside. As well as the logistical barriers
for young people from urban areas, a further barrier can be the lack of a sense
of belonging in rural landscapes that are traditionally seen as places inhabited
by middle class white people [

   ].
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   The participation of young people may also be affected by the conduct of CS
organisations. Some unique issues identified in this study include fears of lone working,
competitive environments and poor relationships between project organisers and
volunteers which have been less frequently cited in the literature. In other CS projects,
volunteers have reported negative perceptions of scientists who have been described as
aloof, intimidating, used unfamiliar jargon and rarely interacted with volunteers which
hindered trust building [

   </a>
   Rotman et al.,
   <a href="#X0-RotmanHammockPreeceetal2014">

   </a>
   ]. Conversely, other studies have reported
concerns among scientists that if citizen scientists lack the necessary skill or proficiency to
follow project protocols or scientists lack confidence in their skills, data may be
de-valued or even discarded [

   </a>
   Burgess et al.,
   <a href="#X0-BurgessDeBeyFroehlichetal2017">

   </a>
   ]. Such concerns may negatively
impact the perceived legitimacy of the project in the eyes of both volunteers and
scientists, necessitating a need to build competency and trust between different
parties.

   Broadening the participation of young people
  </h2>
  <p class="indent">
   The voluntary nature of citizen science raises important questions surrounding the unpaid
nature of many CS projects, which negatively impact young people or socio-economically
disadvantaged groups that cannot afford the demands on their time, and high costs for
transport, accommodation and equipment costs. In some projects, a variety of
compensation and payments such as reimbursements of expenses, small payments from
indirect participation in project activities (e.g., for coordinating or providing
equipment) or crowdfunded projects, as well as direct payments to participants,
may be important to improve inclusivity [
   <a id="x1-29001">
   </a>
   Haklay et al.,
   <a href="#X0-HaklayFraislGreshakeTzovarasetal2021">
    2021
   </a>
   ]. We urge project
organisers to consider financial compensation for participants at the project planning
stage however, we also recognise that the suitability of these approaches needs
to be evaluated according to the resources and the social and cultural context
of the project. Monetary compensation can be one way to overcome financial
barriers for participation, but can also introduce biases, negatively impact volunteer
motivations and compromise data quality [

   ].
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Our study, also identified a range of other ways to acknowledge and recognise
volunteer efforts outside monetary benefits to sustain ongoing motivations to participate
such as creating evidence of the knowledge and skills acquired through certificates,
logged evidence of volunteer hours and accreditation through college and degree courses.
Other suggestions included, acknowledging and celebrating the contribution of citizen
scientists by providing rewards through social events. Therefore, at the start of a project,
project organisers need to provide clear information on the type of compensation or
reimbursements and how benefits or participants will be presented and communicated to
prospective citizen scientists.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   This study identified a lack of awareness of CS projects, as well as an understanding of
the CS role, requirements of the project, level of support provided and benefits were key
barriers to participation. Therefore, targeted promotion, advertising and marketing for
recruiting people may raise awareness and understanding [
   <a id="x1-29004">
   </a>
   Crall et al.,
   <a href="#X0-CrallKosmalaChengetal2017">

   </a>
   ; West &amp;
Pateman,
   <a href="#X0-WestPateman2016">
    2016
   </a>
   ]. This means creating visually appealing and informative advertisements
that detail the purpose, requirements, support offered and benefits of the scheme for
participants. In turn, targeted dissemination of advertisements may improve
recruitment. Traditional approaches to recruitment such as by word of mouth
or through social media channels are likely to recruit people similar to those
already engaged. Therefore, accessing clear entry points into CS particularly for
those with no CS experience, are sometimes crucial and facilitated through other
institutions (e.g., schools, work, universities, churches, community groups) [
   <a id="x1-29006">
   </a>
   Webber,
   <a href="#X0-Webber2011">
    2011
   </a>
   ]. Therefore, tapping into relevant social networks such as student unions,
universities, local community groups and workplaces may extend the reach of
advertisements.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Our study also identified several recommendations for overcoming programmatic and
organisational factors conditional to the management of a CS project. Enhancing
inclusivity is important by creating opportunities for all regardless of prior knowledge,
skills and experiences at the recruitment stage of a project. In these circumstances,
adequate support needs to be built into CS programmes to provide training for
amateur citizen scientists to build knowledge, competency and confidence in their
role.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   To overcome issues of lone working and to build a social component to the CS
experience several suggestions included establishing a buddy system where more
experienced participants mentor amateurs. Similarly, task force groups where volunteers
work together on a task may also build team cohesion. Diversifying CS roles beyond
target data collection was also identified to engage a wider population of young people
with different knowledge and skills. Several suggestions included tailored digital roles
(e.g., creating blogs, newsletters and videos documenting local experiences), public
engagement roles (e.g., to disseminate project outcomes news) and desk-based roles (e.g.,
data entry, and analysis of survey data).
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Following other studies our findings highlight importance of providing social
opportunities for participants to interact with one other through online platforms [

   Asah,
Lenentine &amp; Blahna,
   <a href="#X0-AsahLenentineBlahna2014">
    2014
   </a>
   ]. This could be achieved through WhatsApp, Slack and
Yammer and used to share knowledge, address concerns and updates on project
progress. Building an inclusive working environment by providing a welcoming and
friendly environment was important, for example, several individuals suggested
bringing a friend along to new CS events to build their confidence, particularly for
those with no CS experience. Other ideas including building opportunities to
share opinions and feedback on the project. Several CS projects have integrated
participatory elements into the design of projects where young people express
their ideas, interests through dialogue, face to face conversations and online
forums [

   ]. Collaborative and co-created projects
such as these provides examples of how citizens can interact, feedback, share
knowledge and learning from their experiences with scientists. CS projects that
offer avenues for feedback can also build trust with contributors by sustaining
ongoing motivation to participate [

   Conclusions
  </h1>
  <p class="indent">
   Our results provide novel findings on the motivations, barriers and recommendations of
factors that may enhance youth engagement in CS particularly, those with no prior CS
experience, an often-unexplored group. Our findings show that recruitment strategies
targeting younger people requires a multi-faceted approach to appeal to young people
with different CS experiences particularly, in the exploration of what appeals to
non-engaged groups. However, our small sample size and a lack of accounting for the
diversity of projects that fall under the E-CS and NE-CS categories, may influence the
diversity of personal motivations and outcomes identified by different groups.
Therefore, these findings, may preclude drawing inferences about a larger population.
Similarly, one of our focus groups (E-CS) was skewed toward females which may
have introduced biases within the responses. Future sampling issues could be
overcome by extending the advertisements for participants by identifying specific
selection criteria over a longer time period to achieve the desired participant
characteristics.
  </p>
  <p class="noindent">
   Nonetheless, our research identifies the importance of evaluating personal
motivations, barriers and locally grounded recommendations from people with different
CS backgrounds when developing new projects. Similar efforts to investigate motivations
for participation, particularly among those with no experience of citizen science, should be
conducted across different audiences in different age-groups and life-stages. This effort
will help recruit specific target groups and develop retention strategies for ongoing
projects. Project organisers must also keep in mind their specific project goals and
protocols when designing recruitment strategies as there may be mismatches between the
CS opportunities currently offered and the opportunities sought by people from different
CS backgrounds. Creating or modifying CS projects and CS opportunities to match
interests and sharing research implications of how to best overcome barriers to
participation will enable project organisers to attract new audiences from diverse
backgrounds.
